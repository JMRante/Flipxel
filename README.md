# Flipxel

A web-based puzzle game about flipping panels with shapes to create a picture.

Designed as a "functional game," where game state is mutated in a deterministic, non-realtime manner. Heavily inspired by nonograms (Picross).

Comes with a built-in puzzle editor and can be expanded with custom puzzle packs.

Can be installed as a PWA.

Works on both desktop and mobile.

Contains test coverage for the non-PixiJS parts of the game.

Developed with React and PixiJS.
